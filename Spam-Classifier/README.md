# 📩 SMS Spam Classifier — Machine Learning Web App

A professional end-to-end Machine Learning project that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using a trained classification model and a Streamlit web interface. This project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model training with scikit-learn, evaluation, model persistence, and deployment-ready application development.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or not spam based on their textual content. The project also focuses on deploying the trained model as an interactive web application for real-time predictions.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Text preprocessing and label encoding were performed using pandas  
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) was used for feature extraction  
- Logistic Regression was used as the classification algorithm  
- Model performance was evaluated using Accuracy, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix  
- The trained model and vectorizer were serialized using pickle for reuse  
- The model was integrated into a Streamlit application for real-time inference
