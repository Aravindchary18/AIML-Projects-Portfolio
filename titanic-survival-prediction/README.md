# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction — Machine Learning Web App

A professional end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using a trained classification model and a Streamlit web interface. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training using scikit-learn, model persistence with joblib, and deployment-ready application development.

---

## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on key input features such as passenger class, gender, age, and fare. The project also focuses on deploying the model as an interactive web application for real-time inference.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed using scikit-learn utilities  
- Multiple machine learning techniques from scikit-learn were explored during model development  
- A classification model was trained on Titanic dataset features  
- The trained model was serialized using joblib and loaded into the Streamlit app for inference

## 🎯 Features Used for Prediction

- Passenger Class (Pclass)  
- Sex (Gender)  
- Age  
- Fare  

---

## 🖥️ Application Features

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit  
- Real-time predictions based on user input  
- Simple UI with dropdowns, sliders, and numeric inputs
